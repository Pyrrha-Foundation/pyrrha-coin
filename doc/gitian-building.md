Gitian build
============

This guide takes for granted that you are using Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 as host OS.
The aim of the document is to be able to produce deterministic binaries using gitian-tools and docker containers.

Prerequisite
-------------

These are steps that as to be executed once and that don't need to be repeated for every new gitian build process.

```bash
sudo apt install git apt-cacher-ng ruby docker.io
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
exec su -l $USER  #make effective the usermod command
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://gitlab.com/nexa/nexa.git
git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
cd gitian-builder
bin/make-base-vm --suite focal --arch amd64 --docker
```

Build the binaries
------------------

These are the commands to actually produce the linux x86_64 bit executables :

```bash
cd ~/src/gitian-builder
export USE_DOCKER=1
bin/gbuild -j 4 -m 10000 --url nexa=https://gitlab.com/nexa/nexa.git --commit nexa=dev ../nexa/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux-x86.yml
```

Your binaries will be ready to be used in `build/out/` folder.

To compile binaries for MacOSX darwin first you need to get OSX SDK from here https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs/releases/download/11.3/MacOSX10.15.sdk.tar.xz

Then issue the following command to have the binaries for osx produced and stored in `build/out`


```bash
cd ~/src/gitian-builder
export USE_DOCKER=1
bin/gbuild -j 4 -m 10000 --url nexa=https://gitlab.com/nexa/nexa.git --commit nexa=dev ../nexa/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
```
